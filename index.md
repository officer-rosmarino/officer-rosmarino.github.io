I am a software engineer. I love learning, solving problems and getting into the nitty-gritty of complex issues.

I am a father (soon twice!).

I play drums, although I am not as good as I'd like.

I love music. I've changed my musical taste a lot during the years.

I like making short movies, but I suck at it.

I love hiking and camping. The sense of satisfaction after a hard hike in the nature is something different.

I am a bit of a weird Italian. I will try almost every food that I can, and most likely like it. Except for pineapple pizza, that deserves the death penalty (nah, I'm joking).
