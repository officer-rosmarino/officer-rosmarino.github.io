<!-- List of available emojis here: [text](https://www.fabriziomusacchio.com/blog/2021-08-16-emojis_for_Jekyll/#people--body) -->

I'm an Italian living in Italy :pizza:

I am a software engineer. I love learning, solving problems and getting into the nitty-gritty of complex issues. :man_technologist: 

I am a father (soon twice!). :baby: :heavy_plus_sign: :hourglass_flowing_sand: :baby: 

I play drums, although I am not as good as I'd like. :drum: 

I love music, and I listen to different genres. Some of my favorite artists: Muse, Snarky Puppy, Bed≈ôich Smetana, Massive Attack, John Williams. :notes: 

Every once in a while I like making short movies, although I suck at it. :movie_camera: 

I love hiking and camping. The sense of freedom that comes with a long hike in nature is something else. :mountain: :camping: 

I will try essentially every food that I can, and, most likely, I will like it. Except for pineapple pizza. :plate_with_cutlery:
