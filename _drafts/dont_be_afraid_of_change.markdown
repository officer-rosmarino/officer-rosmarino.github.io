_This article is for myself, to hopefully reference it in the future, should I get ever get stuck like I did in the past. But, hopefully, you might find it useful or inspiring too._

I had spent about 2 years at my first real job when I got an offer from one of the biggest banks in Italy. I was not actively looking, although I was starting to think about changing. I went in for an interview, and the job sounded fine to me: they were looking for a Software Engineer (Java), they were (are) a major company, so very stable, which means a steady income. Pay was above what I was making, so, why not? I took the job.

The first couple of weeks passed by with no actual work: I watched some bullshit corporate onboarding videos, I opened tickets to try to gain access to resources I supposedly needed (I would soon discover that I'd need to perform an intricate dance of tickets and private messages to the people that could actually do things for me to get anything done).

But I could already tell something smelled fishy.

Everyone around me seemed very busy and frustrated. People were in 2 calls simultaneously all the time (?!).

In the meanwhile my inbox and my calendar started to get flooded with emails and meetings I had no context of. Actually trying to reading emails, or going to the meetings, in the hopes they would shed some light on what was my expected contribution, brought not much further information.

I was really confused. Was I stupid? Why did I not understand?

I can now confidently say it was not because of me. Emails where infinite threads of tens of replies, with color-coded inline comments to distinguish different people that replies (expect that colors were not even consistent between replies), while the meetings mostly had no material to read beforehand, of notes after.

After one month, I was struggling to find my place. What was my contribution? What was I supposed to bring to the table? However, I kept telling myself that it was a big company, and it would just take some time to adjust.

_Some time._

Days turned into weeks that turned into months that turned into years.

Before I knew it, 4 years had gone by.

Four years where all I did was attended meetings, 95% of which I could have not gone.

Four years where all I did was improve email filters so that my inbox didn't get over flooded.

Four years where every day I could only look at the clock and ask "When does this work day end?"

Four years I lost (professionally speaking), that I could have spent in another place, learning a lot.

Four years that had also turned into the person I hate the most. A bureaucrat. A pen-pusher (expect in my case, I was forwarding emails).

My excuse initially was "It's a big company, it will take time", then it became "At least it's a secure job" and finally "Well, I guess I'm stuck here now because why would someone else hire me now? What do I even say I do?"

I'd like to say I was a [boiling frog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog), but that wouldn't be honest. A frog can't think. I could and I knew it wasn't right. I didn't feel right. Nevertheless, I kept going.
