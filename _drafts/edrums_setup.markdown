# Electronic drums as good as acoustic drums?

## How I got my e-drum

*Disclaimer! This section is just random info about how I got my electronic kit. Skip to the next section to know how to setup an electronic kit for better sound!*

I started playing drums when I was around 16, maybe 15. At the time, I was a weird mix of that emo/pop punk that was popular in the first half of 2000, and my influence, like a lot of other people, was Travis Barker (my musical taste has luckily changed from Blink 182, but I still think he is a great drummer nowadays).

If you live in an apartment, you will probably have better luck learning the bass, or the guitar, but luckily my family lived (still does) in a big 2 apartment house (the other apartment was my grandparents) that had a huge garage underneath. This had military truck that hadn't moved in years (my grandpa ran a mechanic shop below his house and was an enthusiast of WW2 vehicles that he bought from auctions). The truck was an old [GMC CCKW-353](https://www.armyvehicles.dk/gmc353.htm), and the back is where I had put my drums.

I started taking lessons. I wasn't a great student. Practicing drums is extremely boring. You are supposed to study rudiments for hours and I didn't have the right mindset or patience to do it. I wanted to play my favorite songs.

After a couple of years, my grandma had enough and couldn't stand me playing anymore. I had to give it up. At the time, I though that an electronic kit would solve the problem, but unfortunately didn't have the money for it and my parents weren't going to pay for it.

Years went by. Like, seriously, 10 years. I had almost forgotten about drums. Just every once in a while I thought about it, and I wanted to play, but I couldn't.

Then, one year, I was browsing the Italian *Craigslist* and I found them. Someone was selling a [Roland TD-9 K2](https://www.roland.com/de/products/td-9k2) for 800€. I contacted the seller, who was luckily just 20 minutes away, went to see them, and bought them on the spot.

Best deal I even had, especially as the guy didn't know much about them, and the kit had been upgraded. The basic kit was there, but it also had:

- A [PD-125 pad](https://www.roland.com/de/products/pd-125bk/) as the snare, which you can find at 250-350€;
- A [VH-11 hi-hat](https://www.roland.com/de/products/vh-11/), which sells at 400-500€;
- More cymbals.

Heck, snare and hi-hat were worth the price alone.

And so I began playing again.

I now have this beautiful e-drum kit, and while I still am a bad student, I can play it.

Every once in a while I like to record myself playing. You can find some of my covers on my [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPsU7dZT9rcyPT5h5fnXKXPyTn_1egh-4).
