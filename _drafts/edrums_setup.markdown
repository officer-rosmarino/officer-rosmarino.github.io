# Electronic drums and sound

## Me & drums

I started playing drums when I was around 16, maybe 15. At the time, I was a weird mix of emo/pop punk that was popular in the first half of 2000, and my influence, like a lot of other people, was Travis Barker (my musical taste has luckily changed from Blink 182, but I still think he is a great drummer nowadays).

If you live in an apartment, you will probably have better luck learning the bass, or the guitar, but luckily my family lived (still does) in a big 2 apartment house (the other apartment was my grandparents) that had a huge garage underneath. This had military truck that hadn't moved in years (my grandpa ran a mechanic shop below his house and was an enthusiast of WW2 vehicles that he bought from auctions). The truck was an old <span style="color:red">**INSERT MODEL AND LINK**</span>, and the back is where I had put my drums.

I started taking lessons. I wasn't a great student. Practicing drums is extremely boring. You are supposed to study rudiments for hours and I didn't have the right mindset or patience to do it. I wanted to play my favorite songs.

After a couple of years, my grandma had enough and couldn't stand me playing anymore. I had to give it up. At the time, I though that an electronic kit would solve the problem, but unfortunately didn't have the money for it and my parents weren't going to pay for it.

And so, I gave up drumming.
